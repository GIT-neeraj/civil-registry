# civil-registry
My first disastrous attempt to make a final semester graduation project or any kind of full-stack MVC project for that matter. Civil Registry is an online system allowing individuals to perform registration activities like birth certificate, death certificate, government records like driving license, also to apply for landline telephone connection and water tap connection.
